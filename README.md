## Project Overview

Welcome to Chronos-Compressor, your cutting-edge solution for efficient video data stream optimization! Leveraging advanced algorithms, this Streamlit-powered web application re-engineers your temporal media, significantly reducing file size while preserving stellar visual integrity. Designed with a futuristic interface, Chronos-Compressor offers a dynamic and engaging experience for all your video compression needs.

### Key Features:
-   Temporal Data Stream Upload: Seamlessly upload video files in various formats (.mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .webm).
-   Configurable Compression Matrix: Choose from multiple compression intensities (Quantum-Compressed, Nebula-Optimized, Stellar-Quality) to balance file size and quality.
-   Dynamic Processing Feedback: Engaging, real-time status updates and progress indicators maintain user engagement during compression sequences.
-   Transmission Report: Instantly view original size, optimized size, and total data reduction (MB and percentage saved).
-   Optimized Data Stream Download: Securely download your compressed video file once processing is complete.
-   Intuitive & Responsive UI: A sleek, futuristic design engineered for optimal experience across all device interfaces.

## Deployment Protocols

### 1. Deploying on Streamlit Cloud (Recommended for Public Access)

Streamlit Cloud provides a frictionless deployment environment, allowing you to host your Chronos-Compressor app publicly.

Prerequisites:
-   A GitHub account.
-   This project cloned to your GitHub repository.

Deployment Steps:
1.  Ensure your GitHub repository (e.g., `amoakoh22/chronos-compressor`) contains:
    -   `app.py` (your main Streamlit application file)
    -   `style.css` (your custom CSS styles)
    -   `requirements.txt` (listing all Python dependencies)
2.  Navigate to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/).
3.  Log in with your GitHub account.
4.  Click "New app" and connect to your `chronos-compressor` repository.
5.  Select the branch (e.g., `main`) and set the main file path to `app.py`.
6.  Click "Deploy!"

Important Note on Streamlit Cloud Limitations:
Due to platform resource management, Streamlit Cloud typically imposes a file upload limit. For this application, expect a limit of approximately 200MB per video file when deployed on Streamlit Cloud. For larger files, consider local deployment or a custom server solution.

### 2. Deploying Locally (For Unrestricted Temporal Data Streams)

Running Chronos-Compressor locally bypasses cloud upload limits, allowing you to process significantly larger video files (limited only by your system's hardware capabilities).

[PHASE 0: SYSTEM PREREQUISITES]
-   Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your operating system. Download from: `python.org/downloads`

[PHASE 1: OPERATIONAL SETUP]
1.  Create a dedicated directory for the Chronos-Compressor project files.
    -   Example: `chronos-compressor/`
2.  Transfer the core system files (`app.py`, `style.css`, `requirements.txt`) into this directory.

[PHASE 2: INITIATE COMMAND INTERFACE]
1.  Access your system's terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the Chronos-Compressor project directory using the 'cd' command.
    -   Example (Windows): `cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\chronos video compressor`
    -   Example (macOS/Linux): `cd ~/Downloads/chronos video compressor`
    (Adjust path as per your system's directory structure.)

[PHASE 3: ENVIRONMENT CONTAINMENT]
1.  Initialize a virtual environment to isolate operational dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2.  Activate the newly created environment:
    -   Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    -   macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

[PHASE 4: DEPENDENCY ASSIMILATION]
1.  Install all required Chronos-Compressor modules:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

[PHASE 5: APPLICATION ACTIVATION]
1.  Launch the Chronos-Compressor application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

[PHASE 6: ACCESS PROTOCOLS]
1.  Upon successful activation, the Chronos-Compressor interface will be accessible via your web browser at the designated local URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

## System Requirements (`requirements.txt`)

The following Python packages are required to execute Chronos-Compressor:

```
streamlit
moviepy==1.0.3 # Pinned for stability across environments
imageio
imageio-ffmpeg
```
*Note: FFmpeg is a crucial underlying dependency for MoviePy. It is typically pre-installed on Linux-based cloud environments (like Streamlit Cloud) and can be easily installed on local systems via package managers (e.g., `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS, `sudo apt install ffmpeg` on Ubuntu/Debian).*
